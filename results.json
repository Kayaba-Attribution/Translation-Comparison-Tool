  "Google": "What do you think about Spanish? Well... Actually, it's not that difficult, it's not like my friends say; they say that Spanish is sooooo hard, they are (or are they?) wrong. If you stick to classes (which they don't), learning is not a problem. I've only studied Spanish for almost three years now, and look! My Spanish is so-so already! I can speak a little without a dictionary, it's pretty good. I think I'll continue studying Spanish in high school too. I wonder how good my Spanish will be after three more years of learning this language. Maybe/perhaps (difference?) I can speak Spanish fluently in/in three years? I don't know hahahahaha. I'm writing a letter to someone/someone that doesn't(?) exist, I'm very weird... But it's not important because I'm preparing for my exam in Spanish on Thursday, and that's more important than my thoughts about myself. I have to get an A on my grade, because (it??) is my last semester in elementary school.",

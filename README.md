This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Here's a comprehensive summary of the translation comparison tool app you are building, along with the specifications:

### **Project Summary**
The goal of the app is to allow users to input text, select an original language and a target language, and fetch translations from various APIs. It will display these translations side by side, enabling users to compare different translations and analyze lexical, semantic, and precision differences.

### **App Name**
**Translation Comparison Tool** (You can customize this)

### **Key Features**
1. **Text Input**: Users can enter text for translation.
2. **Language Selection**: Users can choose the original language and the target language from a dropdown menu.
3. **API Integration**: The app will fetch translations from multiple APIs (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL, ChatGPT) based on user input.
4. **Side-by-Side Display**: Show the original text and translations from different APIs next to each other for easy comparison.
5. **Comparison Analysis**: Categorize differences in translations, focusing on:
   - **Lexical Differences**: Variations in word choice.
   - **Semantic Differences**: Differences in meaning.
   - **Degree of Precision**: Evaluate how closely the translations align with the original text.

### **Technical Specifications**
- **Framework**: Next.js (version 13 or later)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Folder Structure**:
  - `src/app/` - Main application folder
    - `page.tsx` - Home page for user input and displaying results
    - `layout.tsx` - Global layout for consistent header/footer across pages
    - `globals.css` - Global styles
    - Additional folders for specific routes (e.g., `/about`)
- **Routing**: Use Next.js App Router for managing routes.
- **APIs to Integrate**: 
  - Google Translate API
  - DeepL API
  - ChatGPT API
- **UI Design**:
  - Simple and intuitive interface for easy user interaction.
  - Responsive design for compatibility with mobile and desktop devices.

### **MVP Development Plan**
1. **Set Up Next.js App**: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and the App Router.
2. **Create Input Form**:
   - Text area for inputting text.
   - Dropdown menus for selecting the original and target languages.
   - A button to submit the request for translation.
3. **API Integration**:
   - Write functions to call the translation APIs and fetch translations based on user input.
4. **Display Translations**:
   - Create a component to display the original text alongside the translations from different APIs.
5. **Comparison Logic**:
   - Implement a basic mechanism to analyze and categorize differences in translations (for future iterations).
6. **Styling**: Use global CSS or Tailwind CSS (if enabled) for styling the components.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Comparison Analysis**: Develop a more sophisticated analysis tool that highlights differences in lexical and semantic aspects.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save their translation comparisons and access them later.
- **Custom Translation Profiles**: Enable users to create profiles that save their preferred settings and past translations.

This summary outlines the core aspects of your translation comparison tool project, setting a clear direction for its development and future enhancements. Let me know if you need further details or specific guidance on any part!
